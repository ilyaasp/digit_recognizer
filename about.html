        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a digit recognizer web based app. This is my first experience on deploying machine learning model.
            Especially in heroku platform. CNN is deep learning technique used on this app. The dataset actually is just 
            basic <strong>mnist</strong> dataset (digit dataset from 0 to 9). The dataset consists of 60000 training data
            and 10000 testing data. The accuracy actually is around 99%. But on some cases the app / model still miss-recognizedd
            the input at this production.
